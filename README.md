# IsingModelPractice


This is an selfe educating project aimed to replicate research of Kyle Mills and Isaac Tamblyn
in Deep neural networks for direct, featureless learning through observation: the case of
2d spin models

The goal of the project is to predict the Hamiltonian (total energy) of a 2D Ising Model
The prediction methods are Random Forest Classifier and Regressor
Random Forest Regressor is much better, but valueble for comparison

The project is completed in Python and Julia
With Julia used primarily for computational tasks and Python for Machine Learing 

There are funcitons for genrating the traing data, trainging models and graphing the result

#### Include friendly files are those that won't run any code, only define function
